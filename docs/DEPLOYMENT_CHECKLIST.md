# Deployment Checklist - GitHub Image Integration

## ‚úÖ Netlify Environment Variables (Already Configured by User)

The following environment variables have been added to Netlify UI:
- `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- `VITE_GITHUB_REPO` - Repository: StayMeaty/melanie-zeyer-website
- `VITE_GITHUB_BRANCH` - Branch: main
- `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` - Admin password hash

## ‚úÖ Repository Configuration Complete

### Files Updated:
1. **netlify.toml** - Enhanced with:
   - Secret scanning exclusion for VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN
   - Headers for GitHub-hosted images with caching
   - Security headers for admin area
   - CORS headers for image access

2. **.env** - Updated with:
   - Comments for GitHub integration
   - Placeholder configuration for local development
   - Note that production uses Netlify UI variables

3. **public/content/blog/images/** - Created with:
   - `.gitkeep` file to ensure directory exists
   - Ready to receive uploaded images

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Netlify
The next push to GitHub will automatically:
- Build with new environment variables
- Enable GitHub image uploads in production
- Make the blog management system fully functional

### 2. Test the Integration
After deployment:
1. Go to `/admin` and login
2. Navigate to Blog Management
3. Create/edit a blog post
4. Click image upload
5. Select "In Repository speichern" (Save to Repository)
6. Upload an image - it will automatically commit to GitHub

### 3. Verify Success
Check that:
- Images appear in `public/content/blog/images/` in your GitHub repo
- Images load correctly in blog posts
- Gallery shows both GitHub and localStorage images
- Fallback to localStorage works if GitHub is unavailable

## üìù How It Works

1. **Upload Flow**:
   - User uploads image in blog editor
   - Image is processed and optimized
   - If GitHub is selected and available:
     - Image uploads to GitHub via API
     - Commits directly to repository
     - Returns GitHub raw URL
   - If GitHub unavailable:
     - Falls back to localStorage
     - Shows notification to user

2. **Image Access**:
   - GitHub images served via: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StayMeaty/melanie-zeyer-website/main/public/content/blog/images/[filename]`
   - After deployment, also available via Netlify CDN at: `https://melaniezeyer.de/content/blog/images/[filename]`

3. **Storage Types**:
   - **GitHub**: Persistent, version-controlled, CDN-delivered
   - **localStorage**: Immediate, browser-based, temporary

## üîí Security Notes

- GitHub token is never exposed in code
- All sensitive variables stored in Netlify UI
- Secret scanning disabled for necessary keys
- Proper CORS headers for image access

## üìä Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour)
- Image upload success rate
- Build times in Netlify
- Console for any errors

## ‚ú® Features Available

With this integration, you now have:
- Direct GitHub repository uploads from blog editor
- Automatic image versioning with Git
- CDN delivery through Netlify
- Fallback to localStorage for reliability
- Progress tracking during uploads
- German language interface
- Hybrid gallery showing all images

## üéâ Ready to Deploy!

Everything is configured and ready. The next deployment will activate the GitHub image integration!
